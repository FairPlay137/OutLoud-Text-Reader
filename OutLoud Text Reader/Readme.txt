OutLoud Text Reader - Beta 1
Thank you for downloading OutLoud Text Reader; an open source, free TTS text reader for Windows!

Known Issues:
 - Only official Microsoft SAPI 5 voices are supported (No LH Michael & Michelle). I may fix this in the future.
 - Pitch changes are only supported through SSML tags
 - Text highlighting may break once the text has exceeded a certain size
 - Only supported XML format is the latest implementation of SSML. This means changing voice pitch, speed, and volume must be done through the <prosody> tag.

Planned Features:
 - Support for more non-Microsoft SAPI 5 voices
 - SAPI 4 support
 - Microsoft Server Speech support
 - Lexicon
 - Better pitch controls
