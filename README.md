# OutLoud Text Reader
An open source, free text reader for Windows, inspired by Speakonia.

I'm only an amateur as of now, so expect some code to be not the best as it could be.

## Compilation
To compile OutLoud, all you will need is Visual Studio 2017. The Community version of VS2017 will do just fine.

*TODO: Work more on this README.md.*
