# OutLoud Text Reader
OutLoud Text Reader is an open source, free text reader for Windows, which tries to take on the look and feel of Speakonia, while still providing advanced features in modern Windows versions.

Note that development on this old codebase is frozen. A rewritten version, which utilizes an all-new backend, will be coming soon.

## Compilation
To compile OutLoud, all you will need is Visual Studio 2017. The Community version of VS2017 will do just fine. Since this *is* a Windows Forms application, you can just open up the solution and just hit Build!

## Planned Features
- Built-in SAPI 4 support
- Built-in Microsoft Speech Platform support
- Pitch adjustment through the side panel
- Support for more voices (like LH Michael, LH Michelle, and all ScanSoft voices)
- Lexicon
- Support for Balabolka's CLI, whose engine is currently more advanced than what is built into OutLoud
